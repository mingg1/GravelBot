# GravelBot
The main idea of the application is to manage and monitor GravelBots by constantly interecting with them, and to set areas to spread gravel.

Because the purpose of our project is to find a use case of autonomous robots, and the robot is currently under research and development phase, there is not available API and way for the application to connect to the robot.
For these reasons, the application has only UI at this stage.
